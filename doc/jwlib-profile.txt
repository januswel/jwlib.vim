SYNOPSIS					*jwlib-profile-synopsis*
>
	" time for 10000 trials
	:echo jwlib#profile#Expression('abs(-1)', 10000)

	" time for a trial
	:echo jwlib#profile#Expression('abs(-1)', 10000) / 10000

DESCRIPTION					*jwlib-profile-description*

Autoload script about profiling.  Here there are descriptions its name start
with "profile", specifically following files.

autoload/jwlib/profile.vim
	Contains functions to profile.

DEPENDENCIES					*jwlib-profile-dependencies*

{only available when your VIM has the |+reltime| feature}

PROVIDES					*jwlib-profile-provides*

Functions:
jwlib#profile#Expression({expr}, {nr})
	Return |Float| that show a time for evaluating {expr} {nr} times.  In
	order to get a time for once, divide a returned value by {nr}
	yourself. >

		:echo jwlib#profile#Expression('abs(-0.3)', 1000) / 1000
<
	Note that profiling is sensitive to OS, background processes, tasks
	etc, so {nr} should be big enough for getting stable time.

	Note that {expr} must have no side-effects - changing a value of
	option or contents of a buffer, writing a buffer, and so on - for
	safety.
