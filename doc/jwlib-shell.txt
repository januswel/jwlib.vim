PROVIDES						*jwlib-shell-provides*

Functions:
jwlib#shell#GetType()
	Returns a String to show type of the 'shell'.  All of returned values
	are listed below.

	value	meaning ~
	cmd	command prompt in win32
	csh	C shell or tcsh
	zsh	Z shell
	sh	Bourne Shell or Bourne-Again Shell

jwlib#shell#GetEncoding([{expr}])
	Returns a String to show encoding used by the 'shell'.  When there is
	{expr} and its evaluated value is true, this function may use a risky
	method to get more exact value.  In particular, changing 'encoding'
	may happen internally, and this processing may have side effects.

	Note that this function falls a long way short of perfection.  Don't
	trust too much.

jwlib#shell#ShellFriendly(path)
	Converts a VIM-native path to shell-friendly.
